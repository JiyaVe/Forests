So, the thing is, this was my first time doing anyhting with Unity, and I should have started learning and viewing the tutorials since 20th July, however, it seems, I had different priorities then, so I delayed it. Later when you asked if I could manage scripts, I thought, " I dont know the first thing about this, but I'll have to learn about it at some point so why not now?" and said 'sure' or whatever.... however later on 21st when I arrived on the Campus, I got into some trouble, I had forgot the key to my room inside my room before I even left campus, realising that, tried to break the lock with a fire extinguisher>lots of noise> dude from hall office came and made a video> due to expensive damage to the door, almost got fined, and scolded> stuck in my friend's room> long story short, three days flew by and I didn't do learn anyhting about Unity, but even then while I had plenty of time to learn, so cutting the excuses short, I still hadn't learnt much by the time you told me to work on the scripts. So, here I am, saying I am sorry, that due to my negligence and incompetence you've had to do most of the work in this Game and the scripts that I did add  are  just modifications of the National Parks Project to meet the needs of this one. Also I was pretty late in completing the scripts even when they were lousy.
So I am gonna have to ask you to assign the assets to the scripts just as they were in the Naional Parks one beccause I don't have the first clue on how to do it. 

In summary, what I wanted to say was that I AM SORRY for being ignorant and mostly useless and I will try my best to never allow it to happen again in this tenure of GDC.
